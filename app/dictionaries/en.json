          "question": "How do I use a bread proofing basket?",
          "answer": "Lightly flour the basket to prevent sticking, then place the shaped dough inside, seam side up. Allow the dough to rise until ready, then gently turn the basket over onto a baking surface. The basket helps maintain the dough’s shape for a beautifully formed loaf."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are bread proofing baskets made of?",
          "answer": "Yes, they are. For rattan baskets, you can tap out the excess flour and use a stiff brush to clean them. Cork baskets can even be washed under water. Liners also help keep them clean."

          "question": "Can I wash my bread proofing basket?",
